Major changes:

folder 2022: major switch from raster to terra
- scripts before changing to terra for most practicals
- more elaborate pseudo-absence practical, with IDW, largely building on disco
- bulk rasterizing range maps still largely based on letsR

folder 2023: switch from dismo to predicts
- remove DOMAIN
- dismo is now only used for gbm.step
