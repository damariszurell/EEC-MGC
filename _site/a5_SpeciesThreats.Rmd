**RStudio project**

Open the RStudio project that we created in the first session. I recommend to use this RStudio project for the entire course and within the RStudio project create separate R scripts for each session. 

- Create a new empty R script by going to the tab "File", select "New File"  and then "R script"
- In the new R script, type `# Session a5: Species threats` and save the file in your folder "scripts" within your project folder, e.g. as "a5_SpeciesThreats.R"

The IUCN Red List of threatened species is a useful resource when analysing diversity changes, species range changes and population changes: www.iucnredlist.org [@IUCN2019]. It provides information on the global conservation status of species, specifically of animals, fungi and plant species. The IUCN has defined a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of species. According to these criteria, species are classified into nine different categories although strictly only five categories describe the conservation status - from least concern to critically endangered [Fig. 1; @IUCN2012]. 

```{r , fig.cap='**Figure 1. The IUCN red list categories. Adapted from [@IUCN2012].**', echo=F, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/redlist.png")
```

The IUCN distinguishes five criteria that are used to classify species into one of the three threatened categories (Fig. 1; @IUCN2012):

- A. Population size reduction
- B. Extent of occurrence (B1) or Area of occupancy (B2)
- C. Small population size and decline
- D. Very small or restricted population
- E. Quantitative analysis (probability of extinction within next 100 years)

All of these information (the red list category, the relevant assessment criteria, the population trends, etc.) are provided by the IUCN. We can look at all these information online, e.g. for the [Balearic Shearwater](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22728432/132658315#conservation-actions). 

Of course, if you want to analyse your species data in light of these IUCN assessments, it can become very tedious to look up all information by hand. The IUCN red list team provides an API for this purpose, and the R package `rredlist` is a client to access this [IUCN red list API](http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/docs). It requires an [API key / a token](http://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/docs) to use the API. You have to indicate your research objectives for using the API. 

I have got permission to use some red list information for the UK breeding birds in class, but I am not allowed to post them. Thus, course participants can download the data (*UK_birds_redlist_status.csv* and *UK_birds_redlist_threats.csv*) in the secured moodle folder (but please be aware that the [IUCN terms of use](https://www.iucnredlist.org/terms/terms-of-use) apply!). External readers are advised to generate an API token:

```{r eval=F}
library(rredlist)
# Generate your personal API token
rl_use_iucn()
```

We will work with the UK breeding bird data from practical 3 available [here](https://damariszurell.github.io/EEC-Macro/data/UK_BBatlas_2008.csv). If not already done so, please download the data and save them in an appropriate folder (e.g. in *data* folder).

```{r}
# Read in the distribution dataset:
bird_dist <- read.table('data/UK_BBatlas_2008.csv',header=T, sep=',', stringsAsFactors = F)

# Species names are contained in the columns:
spp <- names(bird_dist)[-c(1:3)]

# For later usage, we need to remove the underscore in the names:
spp <- sub('_',' ',spp)

```


# IUCN Red list categories

```{r echo=F}
library(rredlist)
load('/Users/zurell/data/Codes/MY_IUCN_REDLIST_KEY.RData')
redlist_status <- read.table('/Users/zurell/data/Lehre/UP_Lehre/EEC/Macroecology/Pracs_Macro/05_IUCN_data/UK_birds_redlist_status.csv', header=T, sep=',')
redlist_threats <- read.table('/Users/zurell/data/Lehre/UP_Lehre/EEC/Macroecology/Pracs_Macro/05_IUCN_data/UK_birds_redlist_threats.csv', header=T, sep=',')
```

If you have your own IUCN API key, you can easily download the information on species' red list categories:
```{r}
# Download red list category for single species using your personal API token "MY_IUCN_REDLIST_KEY"
(rl_search('Gavia stellata', key= MY_IUCN_REDLIST_KEY))
```
```{r eval=F}
# Download red list categories for all species
redlist_status <- do.call(rbind,lapply(spp,FUN=function(sp){rl_search(sp, key= MY_IUCN_REDLIST_KEY)$result}))
```

Course participants can download the data from moodle and read it in:
```{r eval=F}
redlist_status <- read.table('data/UK_birds_redlist_status.csv', header=T, sep=',')
```

Here is an example of the kind of information in the table. Compare this to the information given on the IUCN website, e.g. for the [Balearic Shearwater](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22728432/132658315#conservation-actions).
```{r}
redlist_status[1:10,10:20]
```

## IUCN population trends

We have seen that range size is an important factor for classifying species in a certain red list category. Here, we briefly analyse population trends and range sizes. The necessary information are contained in the red list status data frame. Of course, the extent of occurrance (eoo) specified in the table relates to the global range size of the species. Additionally, you can calculate the range sizes in UK from the available distribution data.

Let's first look at the relation between population trend and global range sizes (extent of occurrence, EOO).
```{r echo=T}
library(ggplot2)

# area against trend
ggplot(data = redlist_status, mapping = aes(x = population_trend, y = eoo_km2)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab('Population trend') + ylab('Extent of occurrence [km2]')
```

If we want to plot the relation between (global) population trend and British range sizes, we first have to calculate these ranges sizes. 
```{r}
# Calculate British range sizes from the distribution atlas
area <- data.frame(spp=spp, area=colSums(bird_dist[,-c(1:3)]))

# Merge the range size information with the redlist table
area <- merge(area, redlist_status[,c('scientific_name','population_trend','eoo_km2')],by.x='spp',by.y='scientific_name')
ggplot(data = area, mapping = aes(x = population_trend, y = area*100)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab('Population trend') + ylab('Distribution area [km2] in UK')
```


<div class="alert alert-info">
**Exercise:**

The redlist table also contains information, for example on realm (marine, freshwater, terrestrial) or on elevation/depth.

- Plot the relationship between population trend and range size separately for marine, freshwater, and terrestrial species.
- Plot the relationship between population trend and range size separately for lowland and highland species.
</div>


## Mapping hotspots of threatened species
Next, I would like to analyse the distribution of threatened species. We can find the relevant red list information in the data frame on the red list status. Then, we need to combine this red list information with the distribution data. To this end, we will have to extract all species that belong to a specific threat category, then compute the species richness of these species per cell and map this.

For example, we can extract all species that are classified as vulnerable:
```{r}
(subset(redlist_status,category=='VU')$scientific_name)
```

Using the red list information we can then map hotspots of species, meaning the species richness of species falling into different red list categories. 
```{r echo=T, warning=F, message=F}
library(raster)

# Identify all vulnerable species 
vu_spp <- subset(redlist_status,category=='VU')$scientific_name
# We have to make sure that species names are written in the same way in the redlist and distribution data
vu_spp <- sub(' ','_', intersect(vu_spp,spp))

# Identify all least concern species
lc_spp <- subset(redlist_status,category=='LC')$scientific_name
lc_spp <- sub(' ','_', intersect(lc_spp,spp))

# Now, we extract the distribution data for the VU and LC species groups, make rasters, stack these and plot
spplot( stack(
  rasterFromXYZ(data.frame(bird_dist[,2:3],log_VU=log(rowSums(bird_dist[,vu_spp])))),
  rasterFromXYZ(data.frame(bird_dist[,2:3],log_LC=log(rowSums(bird_dist[,lc_spp]))))), 
  main='log( species richness)')
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Exercise:**

Map species richness of all species belonging to the threatened categories (CR, EN, VU) and species richness of all species belonging to the non-threatened categories (NT, LC). 

- Discuss the patterns. Where are hotspots of threatened species?

# Red list threats

The IUCN also assesses the main threats per species as you saw in the [Balearic Shearwater](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22728432/132658315#conservation-actions) example. The Threat Classification Scheme can be found [here](https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/threat-classification-scheme). 

If you have your own IUCN API key, you can easily download the information on species' red list threats:
```{r}
# Download red list threats for single species
rl_threats('Gavia stellata', key= MY_IUCN_REDLIST_KEY)
```
```{r eval=F}
# Download red list threats for all species
redlist_threats <- do.call(rbind,lapply(seq_len(length(spp)),FUN=function(i){xi <- rl_threats(spp[i], key= MY_IUCN_REDLIST_KEY); if(length(xi$result)) {data.frame(species=spp[i],speccode=speccodes[i],xi$result) }}))
```

Course participants can download the data from moodle and read it in:
```{r eval=F}
redlist_threats <- read.table('data/UK_birds_redlist_threats.csv', header=T, sep=',')
```

The threats are ordered hierarchically from broad threat type to very detailed threat, e.g.:

- *2 Agriculture & aquaculture* > *2.2 Wood & pulp plantations * > *2.2.1 Small-holder plantations*
- *5 Biological resource use* > *5.4 Fishing & harvesting aquatic resources* > *5.4.3 Unintentional effects: subsistence/small scale (species being assessed is not the target)[harvest]*

Here is an example of the kind of information in the table. For more details, please have a look at the IUCN website, e.g. the [Balearic Shearwater](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22728432/132658315#conservation-actions) example, and at the [Threat Classification Scheme](https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/threat-classification-scheme). 

```{r}
redlist_threats[sample(nrow(redlist_threats),10),-c(1:2)]
```

We can extract many useful information from this table, for example, when specific threats occurred.

```{r}
table(redlist_threats$timing)
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
**Exercise:**

Explore the threats table. For example, 

- Pick a species and identify which threats are causing rapid declines and slow declines. 
</div>


## Mapping hotspots of threats

We can also analyse the spatial distribution of threats. To do so, we need to extract the species that are affected by a particular threat in a particular time period. Then we can extract the distribution data for these species, compute the species richness and map this in space.


```{r echo=T}
# Which ongoing threats are the most common ?
sort(table(subset(redlist_threats, species %in% spp & timing=='Ongoing')$title), decreasing=T)[1:10]

# Identify the species experiencing threats from hunting
spp_threat1 <- sub(' ','_',subset(redlist_threats,title=="Hunting & trapping terrestrial animals" & species %in% spp)$species)
# Identify the species experiencing threats from industry and military
spp_threat2 <- sub(' ','_',subset(redlist_threats,title=="Industrial & military effluents" & species %in% spp)$species)

# Map species experiencing threats from hunting
plot(rasterFromXYZ(data.frame(bird_dist[,2:3],rowSums(bird_dist[,spp_threat1]))), main="Hunting & trapping terrestrial animals")
# species experiencing threats from industry and military
plot(rasterFromXYZ(data.frame(bird_dist[,2:3],rowSums(bird_dist[,spp_threat2]))), main="Industrial & military effluents")
```


<div class="alert alert-info">
**Exercise:**

- Pick two other ongoing threats and map the species richness of those breeding birds affected by these threats.
- Pick a future and a past threat and map the species richness of those breeding birds affected by these threats.

Interpret.
