**RStudio project**

Open the RStudio project that we created in the first session. I recommend to use this RStudio project for the entire course and within the RStudio project create separate R scripts for each session. 

- Create a new empty R script by going to the tab "File", select "New File"  and then "R script"
- In the new R script, type `# Session a2: Species richness gradients` and save the file in your folder "scripts" within your project folder, e.g. as "a2_RichnessGradients.R"
</div>

Today, we will explore species richness gradients in UK breeding birds. We will map species richness, explore the latitudinal species richness gradient, and the species-energy relationships.

# Breeding bird richness

## Distribution data
All analyses of today will be based on a dataset of British breeding and wintering birds recently made available by @Gillings2019. The original data contain breeding bird records in 20-year cycles (1968-1972, 1988-1991, 2008-2011) and wintering bird records in 30-year cycles (1981/1982-1983-1984, 2007/2008-2010/2011) at a 10 km spatial resolution throughout Britain, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Some rarer species are represented at 20 or 50 km resolutions. Here, we will concentrate on bird records from Britain at 10 km resolution during the breeding seasons 2008-2011. The original data are available through the British Trust of Ornithology (www.bto.org; direct download [here](https://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/atlas_open_data_files.zip)). To simplify matters, I have already filtered the data to contain only the relevant breeding records. These cleaned data are available [here](data/UK_BBatlas_2008.csv). Please download the data and save them in an appropriate folder (e.g. in *data* folder).

We can now read in the data into R. 

```{r}
# Read in the distribution dataset:
bird_dist <- read.table('data/UK_BBatlas_2008.csv',header=T, sep=',', stringsAsFactors = F)
```

Let's take a first look at the data and find out what information is contained in there. 
```{r}
str(bird_dist, list.len=10)
```

The data frame contains 230 columns of which the first three columns describe the grid reference and coordinates. The coordinates are provided in the British National Grid, with grid letters and grid digits. The British National Grid is based on a transverse Mercator projection, and the grid letters and grid digits can easily be converted into the so-called Easting and Northing coordinates. All other columns contain presence and absence data of 227 bird species for the breeding seasons 2008-2011. The data contain only species presences with probable or confirmed breeding. The column names are the latin species names. 

Let's plot the spatial distribution of the Willow ptargmigan (*Lagopus lagopus*). As the data are provided for all grid cells in Britain without any holes, we can use the convenient `rasterFromXYZ()` function in the `raster` package for converting the data frame into raster data. 

```{r message=F, warning=F}
library(raster)

# The coordinate reference system for the UK National Grid is:
proj_UK <- '+proj=tmerc +lat_0=49 +lon_0=-2 +k=0.9996012717 +x_0=400000 +y_0=-100000 +ellps=airy +datum=OSGB36 +units=m +no_defs'

r_ptarmigan <- rasterFromXYZ(bird_dist[,c('EASTING','NORTHING','Lagopus_lagopus')], crs=proj_UK)

plot(r_ptarmigan)
```


## Species richness patterns

Now, we map the species richness of breeding birds in Britain. As you have seen, the data frame contains presence and absence records for all breeding bird species for each 10 km cell in Britain. We can use the function `rowSums()` to sum up the number of bird species present at any location (in each row). But be careful to only sum up the columns containing species records, not the columns containing coordinates.

```{r}
richness <- data.frame(bird_dist[,2:3], richness = rowSums(bird_dist[,-c(1:3)]))
head(richness)
```

Again, we can use the `rasterFromXYZ()` function from above to convert this new data frame into a raster object and map this.

```{r message=F, warning=F}
r_richness <- rasterFromXYZ(richness, crs=proj_UK)
plot(r_richness)
```

**How is bird species richness distributed in Britain?**

## Task 2: Latitudinal species richness gradient

As was discussed in the Macroecology lecture, we can analyse different aspects of spatial patterns in species richness  [@Gaston2000a]. First, we plot the latitudinal species richness gradient. For simplicity, we use the Northing coordinates provided in the data frame rather than longitude. The smoothing line gives a first indication whether there are any strong trends. 

```{r message=F}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = richness, mapping = aes(x = NORTHING, y = richness)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="loess") + 
  xlab('Latitude (UK NORTHING)') + 
  ylab('Species richness')
```

**Compare your latitudinal richness gradient with @Gaston2000a and discuss.**

## Species-energy relationships

@Gaston2000a also presented species-energy relationship, for example the relationship between species richness and annual temperature. For this, we need to join the species richness data with climatic data. For convenience, I have already processed worldclim data (19 bioclimatic variables) for you such that the raster stack is projected in the British National Grid at 10 km spatial resolution. You can download the raster stack data [here](data/UK_bioclim.zip). Please save it in your *data* folder and unzip it. We can then load the raster stack data in R:

```{r message=F, warning=F}
clim <- stack('data/UK_bioclim.grd')
plot(clim)
```

To plot the relationship between species richness and summer temperature, we have to extract the climate data for all cells in Britain and join these with the species richness data. 

**Look up the definition of the bioclimatic variables again. Which was is summer temperature?**


```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
# Extract climate data and join with richness data frame
richness2 <- cbind(richness, extract(clim, richness[,1:2]))

# Plot species richness against summer temperature
ggplot(data = richness2, mapping = aes(x = bio10/10, y = richness)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="loess") + 
  xlab('Summer temperature [Â°C]') + 
  ylab('Species richness')
```

Dont' forget to save the species-climate data frame for later:

```{r}
save(richness2,file='data/UK_bird_richness_clim.RData')
```

**Compare this species-energy relationship with @Gaston2000a and discuss.**

# More richness patterns

As mentioned at the beginning of this practical, distribution data of UK breeding birds are available for different decades. Again, I have already processed the data and you can download them
[here](data/UK_BBatlas_1968_2008.csv). Place the data into your *data* folder.

```{r}
# Read in the distribution dataset:
bird_dist2 <- read.table('data/UK_BBatlas_1968_2008.csv',header=T, sep=',', stringsAsFactors = F)

# Look at data, the first three columns contain coordinate information, the 4th column contains the time periods:
head(bird_dist2[,1:20])

# Species names are contained in the remaining columns:
spp <- names(bird_dist2)[-c(1:4)]
spp_names <- sub('_',' ',spp)
```

Again, we can calculate species richness by simply summing up each row. However, we need to take care to use the correct years.

First, I would like to analyse how species richness has changed between different time periods. For this, we first need to compute species richness per time period, for example: 

```{r}
# Which time periods are contained in the data?
unique(bird_dist2$period)

# Extract species occurrences per time period and compute species richness:
birds_68 <- subset(bird_dist2,period=='1968-72')
birds_68$richness68 <- rowSums(birds_68[,spp])

plot(rasterFromXYZ(birds_68[,c('EASTING','NORTHING','richness68')]))
```

_**Exercise:**_

- Calculate species richness for all time periods and map them. The maps below are done using the function `spplot()`. 
- Plot the latitudinal species richness gradients for at least one other time period.
- Plot species richness against annual precipitation sum. Compare with @Gaston2000a and discuss.
</div>

UK breeding bird richness mapped for all time periods using the function `spplot()`

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
# Map species richness
bird_dist2$richness <- rowSums(bird_dist2[,spp])

spplot(stack(
  rasterFromXYZ(subset(bird_dist2,period=='1968-72')[,c('EASTING','NORTHING','richness')]),
  rasterFromXYZ(subset(bird_dist2,period=='1988-91')[,c('EASTING','NORTHING','richness')]),
  rasterFromXYZ(subset(bird_dist2,period=='2008-11')[,c('EASTING','NORTHING','richness')])),
  names.attr = c('1968-72','1988-91','2008-11'), main='Species richness'
  )
```
