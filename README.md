# EEC-MGC

The Master module “Macroecology and global change” is an elective module within the Master programme “Ecology, Evolution and Conservation (EEC)” at the University of Potsdam.

- Module coordinator: Prof. Dr. Damaris Zurell

This site provides the accompanying R practicals for the module. Topics include:

- Macroecological analyses: working with spatial data in R, species range maps, species richness gradients, species richness models
- Species distribution modelling: niche concept, general modelling cycle, advanced algorithms, ensemble modelling

Prerequisites for the module are: basic understanding of macroecology (e.g. from accompanying lecture), basic knowledge of statistics, basic knowledge in geographic information systems, basic understanding of R. If you don’t feel comfortable with R yet, you should work through the [R preparatory course](https://damariszurell.github.io/EEC-R-prep/) first.
